# Sentinel Integrity System (SIS)

**Pre-harm system physics for irreversible decisions.**

---

## What SIS Is

The Sentinel Integrity System (SIS) is **pre-harm integrity infrastructure** that operates *before decisions harden*, to surface conditions of irreversible risk **without policing people, assigning blame, or enforcing outcomes**.

SIS does not manage behavior.  
SIS does not judge morality.  
SIS does not prevent action.

SIS introduces friction **only where silence would otherwise allow irreversible harm**.

If SIS is misunderstood as governance, compliance, monitoring, or ethics enforcement, it has failed.

---

## The Domain SIS Operates In

SIS operates in a domain most systems intentionally avoid:

### The Pre-Harm Epistemic Zone

This zone exists:
- before evidence exists
- before policy applies cleanly
- before violations can be asserted
- before blame is possible
- before outcomes are known

Most tools operate *inside* or *after* decisions.  
SIS operates **before decisions harden**, when reversal is still trivial — and therefore ignored.

---

## The Problem SIS Solves

Modern failures are rarely caused by misconduct.

They occur because:

- trust outruns understanding
- speed outruns reflection
- automation outruns accountability
- authority is delegated faster than error can be absorbed

The most dangerous systems are not inaccurate systems.

They are systems where **a single mistake can no longer be undone**, and no one can say when that threshold was crossed.

SIS exists to prevent **silent irreversibility**.

---

## What SIS Explicitly Refuses To Be

SIS is **not**:

- governance
- compliance
- ethics enforcement
- monitoring
- surveillance
- risk scoring
- reporting
- investigation
- evidence collection
- attribution

SIS must never:
- name individuals
- record decision rationale
- store outcomes
- correlate to harm
- trigger enforcement
- escalate automatically

If SIS does any of the above, it has violated its own integrity boundary.

## How SIS Works (Conceptual)

### Irreversibility Intercept Layer (IIL)

The IIL evaluates **trajectory, not state**, across three axes:

- **Irreversibility** — how difficult reversal would be  
- **Opacity** — how hard the system is to reason about  
- **Asymmetry** — how unevenly consequences are distributed  

No single axis can trigger action.  
All three must converge.

The IIL never blocks decisions.  
It only justifies **friction**.

---

### Integrity Advisory System (IAS)

The IAS issues **Integrity Advisory Statements**.

Advisories:
- describe conditions
- assert no violation
- name no actors
- are non-binding
- expire automatically

IAS exists to make **denial impossible**, not to compel action.

---

## What SIS Produces (And Does Not)

SIS produces:
- momentary friction
- anonymous advisories
- awareness that a trajectory exists

SIS produces **no evidence**, **no decisions**, and **no custody artifacts**.

Anything SIS produces must never be consumed directly by downstream forensic or governance systems.

This separation is intentional and permanent.

---

## Phase-0 Scope

Phase-0 exists to demonstrate **system physics**, not correctness.

### Included
- Irreversibility Intercept Layer (IIL)
- Integrity Advisory System (IAS)

### Explicitly Excluded
- decision capture
- value traces
- AI logic
- dashboards
- integrations (HR, IAM, SIEM, tickets)
- enforcement mechanisms

Phase-0 proves that irreversible trajectories can be surfaced **before harm**, without attribution or enforcement.

---

## Logging Doctrine

SIS logging exists **only** for:

- system enablement
- system disablement
- advisory issuance (anonymous)

### Sole Attribution Exception

A user identifier may be logged **only** when SIS itself is disabled, degraded, or bypassed.

Disabling SIS removes pre-harm protection.  
Anonymous removal of protection invalidates SIS.

Logged on shutdown (minimal):
- user identifier
- timestamp
- scope (partial / full)
- stated reason
- optional re-enable condition

Nothing else.

---

## Trust Boundary Assumptions

SIS assumes:
- partial infrastructure compromise is possible
- cloud isolation may fail
- platform operators are not fully trusted

Therefore:
- advisory meaning remains local
- artifacts are non-inferable cross-tenant
- no centralized authority exists
- ephemerality is a security property

A system designed to surface trust collapse must not rely on unexamined trust.

---

## When SIS Is Most Necessary

SIS is most necessary when:

- rollback is slower than deployment
- authority exceeds explainability
- decision chains outlive decision-makers
- automation acts faster than humans can object
- “no violation occurred” is technically true but practically hollow

After every catastrophic failure, someone asks:

**“Why didn’t anyone slow this down?”**

SIS is the system that proves whether that question was ever answerable.

---

## One-Line Thesis

**Sentinel Integrity System (SIS) is pre-harm system physics: infrastructure that surfaces irreversible integrity risk early, without policing humans or enforcing outcomes, so organizations cannot unknowingly cross lines they cannot uncross.**

## Repository Status

This repository defines **doctrine and system boundaries**.

It is not a product.  
It is not a framework.  
It is not a compliance artifact.

If future work contradicts this README, this README wins unless explicitly amended.
