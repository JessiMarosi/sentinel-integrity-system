# Sentinel Integrity System (SIS)

**Pre-harm system physics for irreversible decisions.**

---

## What SIS Is

The Sentinel Integrity System (SIS) is **pre-harm integrity infrastructure** that operates *before* decisions harden, to surface conditions of irreversible risk **without policing people, assigning blame, or enforcing outcomes**.

SIS does not manage behavior.  
SIS does not judge morality.  
SIS does not prevent action.

SIS introduces **friction only where silence would otherwise allow irreversible harm**.

If SIS is misunderstood as governance, compliance, monitoring, or ethics enforcement, it has failed.

---

## The Domain SIS Operates In

### The Pre-Harm Epistemic Zone

SIS operates in a domain most systems intentionally avoid:

- before evidence exists  
- before policy applies cleanly  
- before violations can be asserted  
- before blame is possible  
- before outcomes are known  

Most systems operate **inside or after** decisions.  
SIS operates **before decisions harden**, when reversal is still trivial—and therefore ignored.

This zone is not ethical, legal, or procedural.  
It is **epistemic**: the space where trajectories form before consequences are legible.

---

## The Problem SIS Solves

Modern failures are rarely caused by misconduct.

They occur because:

- trust outruns understanding  
- speed outruns reflection  
- automation outruns accountability  
- authority is delegated faster than error can be absorbed  

The most dangerous systems are not inaccurate systems.

They are systems where a single mistake can no longer be undone—and no one can say when that threshold was crossed.

SIS exists to prevent **silent irreversibility**.

---

## What SIS Explicitly Refuses To Be

SIS is not:

- governance  
- compliance  
- ethics enforcement  
- monitoring  
- surveillance  
- risk scoring  
- reporting  
- investigation  
- evidence collection  
- attribution  

SIS must never:

- name individuals  
- record decision rationale  
- store outcomes  
- correlate to harm  
- trigger enforcement  
- escalate automatically  

If SIS does any of the above, it has violated its own integrity boundary.

## How SIS Works (Conceptual)

### Irreversibility Intercept Layer (IIL)

The IIL evaluates **trajectory, not state**, across three axes:

- **Irreversibility** — how difficult reversal would be  
- **Opacity** — how hard the system is to reason about  
- **Asymmetry** — how unevenly consequences are distributed  

No single axis can trigger action.  
All three must converge.

Axis values are **non-scalar, non-persistent, and non-comparable across events**.  
They are not scores, signals, or metrics.

The IIL never blocks decisions.  
It only justifies friction.

---

### Integrity Advisory System (IAS)

The IAS issues **Integrity Advisory Statements**.

Advisories:

- describe conditions, not judgments  
- assert no violation  
- name no actors  
- are non-binding  
- expire automatically  

Advisories may introduce **momentary, explicit friction**—for example, a time-bound advisory interruption requiring conscious acknowledgment before continuation.

IAS exists to make **denial impossible**, not to compel action.

---

## What SIS Produces (And Does Not)

SIS produces:

- momentary friction  
- anonymous advisories  
- awareness that a trajectory exists  

SIS produces **no evidence**, **no decisions**, and **no custody artifacts**.

Anything SIS produces must **never** be consumed directly by downstream forensic, governance, compliance, or enforcement systems.

This separation is **intentional and permanent**.

---

## Phase-0 Scope

Phase-0 exists to demonstrate **system physics**, not correctness or completeness.

### Included

- Irreversibility Intercept Layer (IIL)  
- Integrity Advisory System (IAS)  
- Axis model and boundary doctrine  

### Explicitly Excluded

- decision capture  
- value traces  
- AI logic or inference  
- intent modeling  
- dashboards or analytics  
- integrations (HR, IAM, SIEM, ticketing)  
- enforcement mechanisms  

Phase-0 proves that irreversible trajectories can be surfaced **before harm**, without attribution or enforcement.

---

## Logging Doctrine

SIS logging exists only for:

- system enablement  
- system disablement  
- advisory issuance (anonymous)  

### Sole Attribution Exception

A user identifier may be logged **only** when SIS itself is disabled, degraded, or bypassed.

Disabling SIS removes pre-harm protection.  
Anonymous removal of protection invalidates SIS.

Logged on shutdown (minimal):

- user identifier  
- timestamp  
- scope (partial / full)  
- stated reason  
- optional re-enable condition  

Nothing else.

---

## Trust Boundary Assumptions

SIS assumes:

- partial infrastructure compromise is possible  
- cloud isolation may fail  
- platform operators are not fully trusted  

Therefore:

- advisory meaning remains local  
- artifacts are non-inferable cross-tenant  
- no centralized authority exists  
- ephemerality is a security property  

A system designed to surface trust collapse must not rely on unexamined trust.

---

## When SIS Is Most Necessary

SIS is most necessary when:

- rollback is slower than deployment  
- authority exceeds explainability  
- decision chains outlive decision-makers  
- automation acts faster than humans can object  
- “no violation occurred” is technically true but practically hollow  

After every catastrophic failure, someone asks:

> *“Why didn’t anyone slow this down?”*

SIS is the system that proves whether that question was ever answerable.

---

## One-Line Thesis

**Sentinel Integrity System (SIS)** is *pre-harm system physics*: infrastructure that surfaces irreversible integrity risk early, without policing humans or enforcing outcomes, so organizations cannot unknowingly cross lines they cannot uncross.

## Repository Status

This repository defines **doctrine and system boundaries**.

It is not a product.  
It is not a framework.  
It is not a compliance artifact.

If future work contradicts this README, **this README wins** unless explicitly amended.
