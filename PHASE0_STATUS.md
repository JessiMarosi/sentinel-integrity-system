# Sentinel Integrity System (SIS)
## PHASE0_STATUS.md

This document formally declares the completion of **Phase-0** of the Sentinel Integrity System (SIS).

Phase-0 is complete.

No further output, implementation, or expansion is required for this phase.

---

## Purpose of Phase-0

Phase-0 exists to establish **doctrine and system physics**, not to deliver functionality.

The goal of Phase-0 is to define:

- what SIS is
- what SIS is not
- the domain SIS operates in
- the boundaries SIS must never cross
- the conditions under which SIS is allowed to exist at all

Phase-0 is successful if SIS is *legible*, *bounded*, and *non-extendable without intent*.

---

## Phase-0 Scope (Completed)

Phase-0 consists exclusively of the following artifacts:

- README.md
- BOUNDARIES.md
- NON-GOALS.md
- SYSTEM_PHYSICS.md
- AXES_MODEL.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- PHASE0_STATUS.md

These documents together define the complete Phase-0 system.

No additional artifacts are required.

---

## Explicit Exclusions (By Design)

Phase-0 explicitly excludes:

- executable code
- reference implementations
- simulations
- dashboards or visualizations
- integrations of any kind
- metrics, scoring, or ranking
- alerts or notifications
- enforcement mechanisms
- attribution systems
- storage or persistence layers
- products, frameworks, or services

The absence of these elements is intentional.

Adding them would not advance Phase-0.
It would violate it.

---

## Definition of Complete

Phase-0 is complete when:

- SIS can be understood without implementation
- SIS cannot be mistaken for governance, compliance, or enforcement
- SIS cannot be operationalized accidentally
- SISs integrity depends on restraint, not execution
- irreversible risk is made conceptually visible without authority

All of these conditions are met.

---

## Freeze Declaration

Phase-0 is **frozen**.

Future work, if any, must:

- explicitly reference Phase-0
- treat Phase-0 doctrine as immutable
- add new phases without revising Phase-0
- justify any deviation as a conscious departure

Silent revision of Phase-0 is prohibited.

---

## Non-Expectation Clause

Phase-0 does not promise:

- adoption
- deployment
- validation
- correctness proofs
- safety guarantees
- harm prevention

Phase-0 exists to define a system that could exist
without asserting that it should.

---

## Closing Statement

Phase-0 is complete.

SIS now exists as a bounded system concept.

Nothing further is required at this stage.
