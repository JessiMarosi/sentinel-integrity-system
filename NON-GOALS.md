# Sentinel Integrity System (SIS)
## NON-GOALS.md

This document defines what the Sentinel Integrity System (SIS) **explicitly does not attempt to do**.

These are not missing features.
They are **intentional absences** required to preserve SIS integrity.

If SIS ever appears incomplete, underpowered, or frustrating because of these exclusions, it is functioning correctly.

---

## 1. SIS Is Not Trying to Prevent Harm

SIS does not guarantee safety.
SIS does not ensure correct decisions.
SIS does not prevent failure.

Harm may still occur with SIS present.

SIS exists to surface **conditions of irreversible risk** early enough that action *could* be reconsidered  not to ensure that it *is*.

Any attempt to convert SIS into a harm-prevention mechanism violates its core design.

---

## 2. SIS Is Not a Governance System

SIS is not designed to:

- define acceptable behavior
- enforce policy
- encode organizational values
- align decisions to regulations
- resolve ethical ambiguity
- formalize accountability

Organizations already have governance systems.
Those systems operate **after** decisions harden.

SIS intentionally operates outside that domain.

---

## 3. SIS Is Not a Compliance Tool

SIS does not:

- map to regulatory frameworks
- generate compliance evidence
- assist audits
- produce attestations
- reduce regulatory exposure

If SIS output becomes useful for compliance reporting, SIS has failed.

Compliance requires stability and traceability.
SIS relies on ephemerality and non-attribution.

These goals are incompatible.

---

## 4. SIS Is Not Monitoring or Surveillance

SIS does not:

- observe individuals
- track behavior over time
- record decision histories
- analyze usage patterns
- perform behavioral analytics

SIS does not watch people.
It watches **trajectories**.

Any feature that increases observability of humans rather than systems violates SIS intent.

---

## 5. SIS Is Not Risk Scoring or Prediction

SIS does not:

- assign risk scores
- calculate probabilities
- rank decisions
- estimate likelihoods
- predict outcomes

SIS surfaces **directional convergence**, not quantified risk.

Once risk is scored, it becomes optimizable.
Once optimizable, it becomes enforceable.
Once enforceable, SIS is no longer SIS.

---

## 6. SIS Is Not Evidence Collection

SIS does not:

- collect admissible evidence
- preserve artifacts for investigation
- maintain chain of custody
- support post-incident reconstruction
- feed forensic pipelines

SIS output must never be sufficient to prove wrongdoing.

SIS exists precisely because evidence often arrives too late to prevent irreversible harm.

---

## 7. SIS Is Not Decision Support

SIS does not:

- recommend actions
- suggest alternatives
- evaluate trade-offs
- justify decisions
- explain what should be done

SIS introduces **friction**, not guidance.

Interpretation remains human.
Responsibility remains human.
Action remains human.

---

## 8. SIS Is Not Automation Control

SIS does not:

- slow deployments automatically
- pause workflows
- throttle systems
- require acknowledgments
- mandate approvals

SIS does not interfere with execution.
It interferes with certainty.

Any automatic intervention crosses the enforcement boundary.

---

## 9. SIS Is Not an Intelligence System

SIS does not aim to:

- become smarter over time
- learn from outcomes
- optimize detection accuracy
- reduce false positives
- adapt based on feedback loops

Learning requires memory.
Memory creates leverage.
Leverage creates authority.

SIS refuses authority.

---

## 10. SIS Is Not Centralized Insight

SIS does not:

- aggregate across teams
- aggregate across time
- aggregate across tenants
- create organizational dashboards
- provide executive summaries

Centralized insight converts local awareness into institutional power.

SIS is intentionally local, ephemeral, and non-transferable.

---

## 11. SIS Is Not a Product (Yet)

Phase-0 SIS is not attempting to be:

- sellable
- integrable
- user-friendly
- market-ready
- demonstrable via UI

Phase-0 exists to prove **system physics**, not adoption.

Productization without boundary erosion is a future research problem, not a Phase-0 goal.

---

## 12. SIS Is Not for Everyone

SIS is not designed for:

- organizations seeking liability shields
- teams wanting enforcement without responsibility
- leadership seeking plausible deniability
- environments that demand certainty

SIS increases discomfort.
SIS removes excuses.
SIS makes silence visible.

Organizations unwilling to tolerate that discomfort should not deploy SIS.

---

## Closing Statement

SIS is defined more by what it refuses to do than by what it provides.

Every exclusion in this document exists to preserve one thing:

The ability to surface irreversible risk **without becoming an authority over human decisions**.

If SIS ever feels incomplete, ask whether the missing feature would make decisions easieror merely quieter.

SIS exists to prevent quiet irreversibility.
